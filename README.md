GitHub restricts the size of uploaded data. We only share code here, and once the data upload is complete, we will publicly release the link.

codes:
    - 6Graph: we add target generation step


- data
    - 6GAN: 
        - conda virtual enviroment. The author didn't provde the detailed versions of each dependency. It costs much time to deal with the incompatible dependencies for a novice in nerual networks. You can use our enviroment to run 6GAN directly without additional configurations.
    - 6Graph: generated targets and responsive addresses on 9 datasets.
